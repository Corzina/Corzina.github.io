::: {#hero-heading}

Greetings! I'm Ilya Fominykh, a researcher specializing in statistics and quantitative methods for the social sciences. My work focuses on survey data analysis, digital trace data, and quasi-experimental designs. I am particularly interested in electoral behavior, value change, and other topics at the intersection of individual dynamics and societal trends.

Welcome to my portfolio, where you can explore my academic and applied research in data-driven social science.
