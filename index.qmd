Greetings! I'm Ilya Fominykh, a Research Assistant at Utrecht University with a strong passion for quantitative methodology in the social sciences, Bayesian statistics, and survey data analysis. My research interests encompass a diverse range of topics, including electoral dynamics, regime transitions, and more.

I'm actively engaged in numerous research projects that align with my expertise. Currently, I'm a dedicated member of a research group investigating technological illiberalism and the contemporary challenges associated with [democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding). Additionally, I'm actively contributing to projects that explore Bayesian approaches in exploratory factor analysis.
