::: {#hero-heading}
Greetings! My name is Ilya Fominykh, and I am a researcher with a background in quantitative methods for social sciences with an emphasis on survey data analysis, digital trace data analysis, and Bayesian statistics. My research interests encompass a range of topics including electoral studies and E-voting, the dynamics of individual values, and more.

Currently, I participate in several research groups that focus on the intersection of political science and data science. Additionally, I'm actively contributing to projects that explore Bayesian approaches in exploratory factor analysis.

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where you can explore my journey and contributions in the world of data-driven research and analysis.
