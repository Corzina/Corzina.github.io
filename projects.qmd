## Methodology and Statistics

**COMPARING BAYESIAN APPROACHES TO EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS** |  *Research Project * | 2023-ongoing

Contributed to a comparative study of R packages for Bayesian exploratory factor analysis (EFA), aiming to evaluate their performance and underlying assumptions. The project supports the development of a robust framework for future simulation-based validation of BEFA methods. Co-authoring a research paper based on the study’s findings.

**COMBINING DIGITAL TRACE DATA AND SURVEY DATA FOR PARTICIPATION PREDICTION** |  *Thesis Project* | 2023-2024

Investigated integration of digital trace and survey data, specifically addressing bias from selective participation. Explored sources of bias and analyzed data enrichment techniques that allow to enhance accuracy and inclusiveness of demographic groups typically underrepresented in survey research.

## Political Science

**YOUTH INDOCTRINATION: WILL IT ACHIEVE LOYALTY OR HATRED?** |  *Research Project * | 2023 - ongoing

This project investigates the effects of state-driven propaganda in schools on youth political attitudes and values. Using a quasi-experimental design, We examine how exposure to soft propaganda influences political trust, civic engagement, and nationalist sentiments among adolescents.

**TECHNOLOGICAL ILLIBERALISM: ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES** |  *Research Project * | 2024 - 2025

Analyzed how digital infrastructure and emergency-era policies affect electoral outcomes in authoritarian contexts, using data on online voting in Russia. Co-authored a working paper on youth political attitudes and state-led digital securitization, available [here](https://www.illiberalism.org/the-rise-of-tech-illiberalism-in-russia-e-voting-and-new-dimensions-of-securitization/).

**REPLICATION STUDY OF INEQUALITY TRAP BY ERIK USLANER** |  *Research Project * | 2021 - 2022

Replicated Uslaner’s findings on the links between inequality, corruption, and generalized trust using recent waves of the World Values Survey and European Social Survey. Results matched the original study. Project results are available [here](https://www.hse.ru/ba/political/students/diplomas/620109658).

**STRATEGIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES** |  *Study Project * | 2021 - 2022

**COMPARATIVE ELECTORAL STUDIES** |  *Study Project * | 2019 - 2020

I prepared and analysed electoral data on Switzerland and Ireland with R.F. Turovsky. Electoral ballots are published on the site of the *Laboratory for Regional Research *, available [here](https://cfi.hse.ru/lrps/elb).
