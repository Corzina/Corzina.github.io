    "text": "Greetings! I’m Ilya Fominykh, a Research Assistant at Utrecht University with a strong passion for quantitative methodology in the social sciences, Bayesian statistics, and survey data analysis. My research interests encompass a diverse range of topics, including electoral dynamics, regime transitions, and more.\nI’m actively engaged in numerous research projects that align with my expertise. Currently, I’m a dedicated member of a research group investigating technological illiberalism and the contemporary challenges associated with democratic backsliding. Additionally, I’m actively contributing to projects that explore Bayesian approaches in exploratory factor analysis.\nWelcome to my developer portfolio, where you can explore my journey and contributions in the world of data-driven research and analysis.\n\n\nUTRECHT UNIVERSITY, UTRECHT | Master in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences | Track: Applied Data Science | 2022-ongoing\nI am currently studying Bayesian statistics, machine learning, missing data, and sparse data analysis and working on my thesis on combining digital trace data and survey data for participation prediction.\nHIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, MOSCOW | Bachelor in Political Science | Track: Political Analysis | 2018-2022\nI specialized in quantitative data for social sciences, survey data analysis and structural equation modeling, gratuated with honors and GPA of 8.8\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICS | Research Assistant | Sep 2023 - Ongoing  | Utrecht University\nI explored packages for Bayesian exploratory factor analysis currently available in R and prepared a framework for a simulation study.
