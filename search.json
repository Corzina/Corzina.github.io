The project supports the development of a robust framework for future simulation-based validation of Bayesian EFA methods. Co-authoring a research paper based on the study’s findings.\nCOMBINING DIGITAL TRACE DATA AND SURVEY DATA FOR PARTICIPATION PREDICTION | Thesis Project | 2023-2024\nMy thesis investigates the integration of digital trace data with traditional survey methods, aiming to improve representativeness by boosting response accuracy among demographic groups that are typically underrepresented and less likely to share their data. To address this, I examined the sources of bias and developed data enrichment techniques designed to enhance the representativeness of the collected data."

Using a quasi-experimental design, I examine how exposure to both soft and hard forms of propaganda influences political trust, civic engagement, and nationalist sentiments among adolescents. More can be found here\nTECHNOLOGICAL ILLIBERALISM: ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES | Research Project  | 2024 - 2025\nThe research explored how digital technologies and emergency-era policies—particularly those introduced during COVID-19—affect electoral outcomes and democratic institutions. Using quantitative data on online voting in Russia, the project analyzes how the state’s digital infrastructure facilitates electoral manipulation, surveillance, and coercive governance under the guise of modernization and convenience. I Co-authored a working paper analyzing shifts in youth attitudes toward the state and political participation, which can be found here.\nREPLICATION STUDY OF INEQUALITY TRAP BY ERIK USLANER | Research Project  | 2021 - 2022\nAs my research practice and a part of my bachelor thesis, I replicated the study by Erik Uslaner on the relationship between inequality, corruption, and generalized trust. Using the latest Wave of the WVS (World Values Survey) and ESS (European Social Survey), I acquired the same results as presented in the original study, available here.\nSTRATEGIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES | Study Project  | 2021 - 2022\nI analyzed the recent trends in centralized autocratic party formation using data from the 2021 Russian elections. You can find the paper on this analysis in the Russian Politics journal, available here.\nCOMPARATIVE ELECTORAL STUDIES | Study Project  | 2019 - 2020\nI prepared and analysed electoral data on Switzerland and Ireland with R.F. Turovsky. Electoral ballots are published on the site of the Laboratory for Regional Research , available here"
