The project supports the development of a robust framework for future simulation-based validation of BEFA methods. Co-authoring a research paper based on the study’s findings.\nCOMBINING DIGITAL TRACE DATA AND SURVEY DATA FOR PARTICIPATION PREDICTION | Thesis Project | 2023-2024\nInvestigated integration of digital trace and survey data, specifically addressing bias from selective participation. Explored sources of bias and analyzed data enrichment techniques that allow to enhance accuracy and inclusiveness of demographic groups typically underrepresented in survey research."

Using a quasi-experimental design, We examine how exposure to soft propaganda influences political trust, civic engagement, and nationalist sentiments among adolescents. More can be found here.\nTECHNOLOGICAL ILLIBERALISM: ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES | Research Project  | 2024 - 2025\nAnalyzed how digital infrastructure and emergency-era policies affect electoral outcomes in authoritarian contexts, using data on online voting in Russia. Co-authored a working paper on youth political attitudes and state-led digital securitization, available here.\nREPLICATION STUDY OF INEQUALITY TRAP BY ERIK USLANER | Research Project  | 2021 - 2022\nReplicated Uslaner’s findings on the links between inequality, corruption, and generalized trust using recent waves of the World Values Survey and European Social Survey. Results matched the original study. Project results are available here.\nSTRATEGIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES | Study Project  | 2021 - 2022\nI analyzed the recent trends in centralized autocratic party formation using data from the 2021 Russian elections. You can find the paper on this analysis in the Russian Politics journal, available here.\nCOMPARATIVE ELECTORAL STUDIES | Study Project  | 2019 - 2020\nI prepared and analysed electoral data on Switzerland and Ireland with R.F. Turovsky. Electoral ballots are published on the site of the Laboratory for Regional Research , available here."
