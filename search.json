Quantitative electoral data is used in the project.\nSOFT AND HARD PROPAGANDA AND TRANSFORMATION OF VALUES | Research Project  | 2023 - ongoing\nI use quasi-experimental design to investigate the impact of both soft and hard propaganda, as presented within Russian educational institutions, on the transformation of values. The study relies on quantitative survey data for analysis and insights.\nSTRATEGIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES | Research Project  | 2021 - 2022\nI analyzed the recent trends in centralized autocratic party formation using data from the 2021 Russian elections. You can find the paper on this analysis in the Russian Politics journal.\nCOMPARATIVE ELECTORAL STUDIES | Study Project  | 2019 - 2020\nI prepared and analysed electoral data on Switzerland and Ireland with R.F. Turovsky. Electoral ballots are published on the site of the Laboratory for Regional Research , HSE."
