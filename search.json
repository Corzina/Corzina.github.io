Quantitative data on online voting in Russia is utilized in the project.\nYOUTH INDOCTRINATION: WILL IT ACHIEVE LOYALTY OR HATRED? | Research Project  | 2023 - ongoing\nI use quasi-experimental design to investigate the changes in both soft and hard propaganda, as presented within Russian educational institutions, on the transformation of youth values. The study relies on quantitative survey data for analysis and insights.\nREPLICATION STUDY OF INEQUALITY TRAP BY ERIK USLANER | Research Project  | 2021 - 2022\nAs my research practice and a part of my bachelor thesis, I replicated the study by Erik Uslaner on the relationship between inequality, corruption, and generalized trust. Using the latest Wave of the WVS (World Values Survey) and ESS (European Social Survey), I acquired the same results as presented in the original study, available here.\nSTRATEGIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES | Study Project  | 2021 - 2022\nI analyzed the recent trends in centralized autocratic party formation using data from the 2021 Russian elections. You can find the paper on this analysis in the Russian Politics journal, available here.\nCOMPARATIVE ELECTORAL STUDIES | Study Project  | 2019 - 2020\nI prepared and analysed electoral data on Switzerland and Ireland with R.F. Turovsky. Electoral ballots are published on the site of the Laboratory for Regional Research , available here"

    "text": "Greetings! My name is Ilya Fominykh, and I am a researcher with a background in quantitative methods for social sciences with an emphasis on survey data analysis, digital trace data analysis and Bayesian statistics. My research interests encompass a range of topics including electoral studies and E-voting,\ndynamics of individual values, and more.\nCurrently, I participate in several research groups that focus on the intersection of political science and data science. Additionally, I’m actively contributing to project that explore Bayesian approaches in exploratory factor analysis.\nWelcome to my personal portfolio, where you can explore my journey and contributions in the world of data-driven research and analysis.\n\n\nUTRECHT UNIVERSITY, UTRECHT | MSc in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences | Track: Applied Data Science | 2022-2024\nI studied clustering algorithms, ML-approaches, neural networks, low- and high-dimensional data analysis. My thesis explored sources of error in linked survey data and donated digital trace data.\nHIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, MOSCOW | Bachelor in Political Science | Track: Political Analysis | 2018-2022\nMy specialization was in quantitative data analysis within the social sciences, focusing on time-series and multilevel data, as well as structural equation modeling. Graduating with honours, I attained a GPA of 8.9.\nVCIOM SOCIOLOGIC SCHOOL | Winter School | Track: Policy and Market Analysis | 2022\nI learned about the survey design and data collection, applying knowledge to solve business cases.\nDULWICH COLLEGE, LONDON | Summer School | Track: Global Young Leaders | 2017\nI learned about the basics of international relations, effective communication, and economics.\n\n\n\nBartsParts B.V. | Junior Business Analyst | June 2024 - Ongoing | Leiden\nI operate SQL queries to extract data from the company’s database and perform data analysis to optimize the company’s operations.\nDEPARTMENT OF METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICS | Research Assistant | Sept 2023 - June 2024 | Utrecht University\nI explored packages for Bayesian exploratory factor analysis currently available in R and prepared a framework for a simulation study. Now I am participating in writing an article on this topic.\nSUMMER SCHOOL “SURVEY DESIGN: ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATION” | Teaching Assistant | Aug 2023 | Utrecht University\nI helped summer school students to understand foundations of survey-based research & master basic R usage for survey data analysis.\nDEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE | Research Assistant | Feb 2022 - Sept 2022 | Higher School of Economics\nI collaborated on a research project led by D.Y. Rosenberg, which focused on the intersection of COVID-19 and the political bargaining process. My responsibilities encompassed data wrangling, in-depth analysis, and contribution to the literature review.\nHOLDING “MINCHENKO CONSULTING” | Junior Analyst | Jul 2020 - Feb 2022 | Analytic Department\nI analysed data on Russian first-range officials spouses in social and traditional media and developed description of self-representation strategies.
